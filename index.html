                        My name is Jayrald John C. Dalman, I am 21 years old, and I live in Maslog, Danao City. When I
                        was a child, I was an introvert, but I cared deeply about people. Whenever I saw someone crying,
                        I would give them my sticker collection to cheer them up, which showed my empathy toward those
                        who were sad. During elementary school, I consistently ranked between the top 2 and 4 in my
                        class, and I really liked the education system back then.

                    <div class="description">
                        When I passed the entrance exam for SciTech, I felt sad that some of my classmates didn’t make
                        it. Honestly, I never really liked being around people who were much smarter than me (though I
                        didn’t envy them). I preferred being with those who weren’t too academically gifted and wanted
                        me to tutor them. However, my lack of communication skills made this difficult. Even though I
                        had a group of friends, I often felt like nobody. I also struggled to find a partner for group
                        activities, but thankfully, things eventually worked out.

                    <div class="description">
                        During my senior high school years, I struggled to find the right course for me. I dreamed of
                        becoming a game developer, so I looked for a course closely related to that field. I discovered
                        that Computer Science would be the most suitable choice, but unfortunately, CTU didn’t offer
                        that course. Studying at other schools like CIT was also challenging due to tuition fees.
                        Because of this, I chose Computer Engineering at CTU, as it includes Computer Science subjects
                        and could still lead me to a game development career. I knew I would struggle with hardware and
                        electrical subjects, but I was determined to do my best.

                    <div class="description">
                        I don’t know what the future holds—whether I will become a game developer or not. There is also
                        uncertainty in our third year regarding whether we will continue with engineering in our fourth
                        year or become irregular students if we transfer to another school. However, I remain hopeful
                        that everything will work out in the end.
